**Behaviour Analysis -->**
Calculate the Attrition Rate :
**1. Attrition Rate** = DIVIDE(SUM(HR_Analytics[Attrition Qty]),COUNT(HR_Analytics[EmployeeCount]))

( The idea is to know how unsatisfied Employees are and leaving the company due to lower Job Satisfaction )

**3. AR WLB** = CALCULATE([Attrition Rate], HR_Analytics[WorkLifeBalance] <= 2.76)
